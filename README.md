# medical_assistant_chatbot
Medical Assistant chatbot using openai gpt 4o mini model with a gradio interface.
Here are a few pointers about the project:
1) This project uses the 4o mini model by default, you can experiment with different models.
2) I have included the .env and environment.yml files in which you can add your openai API key and create a virtual env.
3) It uses the default gradio chat interface.
